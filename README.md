The main idea for this exercise follows the same principle as studying with index cards.  
Read the question, try to answer it, and then check your answer by clicking the 'Show/Hide' button.

The user will also be able to navigate to the next item within the same category, go to the main menu and choose another category,
or exit the progam altogether.

Testing was conducted after each category completion to check formatting, spelling, and grammar and whether the
navigation functions were working properly.

As you can see, this restaurant has A LOT of items on the menu.  Can you guess the restaurant?
